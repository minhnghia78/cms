2. Enable independent development of backend and frontend
3. Provide clear API documentation and communication patterns
4. Support modern development practices and tools
5. Ensure maintainable and extensible codebase

## Success Criteria
- Backend serves RESTful APIs successfully
- Frontend can communicate with backend via axios
- Both components can be developed and deployed independently
- Clear documentation and setup instructions
- Modern development environment with hot reloading

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.4.7, Java 17+, Maven
- **Frontend**: React.js, axios, Node.js, npm/yarn
- **Development**: Hot reloading, CORS configuration, development servers
