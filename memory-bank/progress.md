## Current Status
- **Backend**: Production-ready with comprehensive CMS features
- **Frontend**: Basic development setup only, needs complete implementation
- **Overall Progress**: ~40% complete (backend done, frontend to be built)

## Known Issues
1. **Frontend Axios Missing**: Need to add axios dependency for API communication
2. **No Authentication UI**: Frontend has no login/authentication interface
3. **Backend Documentation Gap**: README mentions H2 database but using MySQL
4. **Frontend-Backend Gap**: No integration between React frontend and Spring Boot APIs

## Next Milestone
**Goal**: Complete authentication implementation
**Target**: Users can register, login, and access protected content based on their roles
**Components**: Login form, authentication context, protected routes, basic dashboard
