# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Phase**: Frontend Development & Integration
**Priority**: Implement CMS frontend interface with authentication integration

## Recent Changes
1. **Backend Completion**: Comprehensive CMS backend is fully implemented
   - Spring Security with JWT authentication
   - Role-based access control (ADMIN, USER)
   - Complete CRUD operations for Users, Categories, Posts
   - MySQL database integration with proper entity relationships
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

2. **Frontend Setup**: React/TypeScript foundation established
   - React 19.1.0 with TypeScript 5.8.3
   - Vite 7.0.4 build tooling
   - Tailwind CSS 4.1.11 for styling
   - Basic project structure in place

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Add Axios for API communication
   - Implement authentication components (login, register)
   - Create authentication context for state management
   - Build protected route system

2. **CMS Interface Development**:
   - Dashboard layout with navigation
   - User management interface (ADMIN role)
   - Content management (Posts CRUD)
   - Category management interface

3. **User Experience**:
   - Responsive design implementation
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Form validation and user feedback
   - Dark mode support (optional)

## Active Decisions
- **Authentication Flow**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage with axios interceptors
- **State Management**: React Context API for authentication state, local state for components
- **UI Framework**: Pure Tailwind CSS without additional component libraries
- **API Integration**: Axios with centralized error handling and request/response interceptors

## Blockers & Considerations
- Frontend currently has basic Vite template - needs complete CMS implementation
- Need to add Axios dependency for API communication
- Authentication state management strategy needs implementation
- Role-based UI components need to be developed

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Users can authenticate and receive JWT tokens
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- [ ] ADMIN users can manage all entities
- [ ] USER role can create and manage own content
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
