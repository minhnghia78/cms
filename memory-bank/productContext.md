# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This full-stack application template provides a modern, scalable foundation for building web applications that require both server-side processing and rich client-side user interfaces.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Development Complexity**: Separates backend and frontend concerns for easier maintenance
2. **Technology Integration**: Provides proven patterns for Spring Boot + React.js integration
3. **API Communication**: Establishes clear patterns for frontend-backend communication via axios
4. **Development Workflow**: Enables independent development and testing of both components
5. **Scalability**: Supports growth from simple CRUD operations to complex business logic

## How It Should Work
- **Backend**: Serves RESTful APIs, handles business logic, manages data persistence
- **Frontend**: Provides user interface, manages client-side state, communicates with backend
- **Communication**: HTTP requests/responses using axios for reliable API calls
- **Development**: Hot reloading for both components, clear separation of concerns

## User Experience Goals
- **Developers**: Easy setup, clear documentation, intuitive project structure
- **End Users**: Responsive, fast, reliable web application experience
- **Maintainers**: Clean code, clear patterns, easy to extend and modify

## Key Features
- RESTful API design
- Modern React.js with hooks and functional components
- Axios for reliable HTTP communication
- CORS configuration for development
- Hot reloading for both backend and frontend
- Clear project structure and documentation
